# Deep Learning with PyTorch – From Concept to Application

This repository provides structured summaries, practical notebooks, and essential resources based on the course **"Deep Learning with PyTorch – From Concept to Application"** by **Mohamed Sebaie**. The course takes a hands-on approach, helping learners understand core concepts and apply deep learning techniques to real-world problems using PyTorch.

## Course Overview

The course begins with the fundamentals of PyTorch and gradually builds up to more advanced topics and real-life applications in computer vision and natural language processing. It is designed for beginners and intermediate learners looking to build a strong foundation and practical skills.

## Key Topics Covered

- Introduction to PyTorch and its ecosystem
- Building and working with tensors
- Creating and training neural networks
- Evaluation techniques: confusion matrix, classification report, and more
- Computer Vision with CNNs:
  - Image classification
  - Transfer learning using pre-trained models
- NLP (Natural Language Processing):
  - Text data preprocessing
  - Training models for language understanding
- Model deployment using Gradio and Hugging Face
- Real-world application development using PyTorch

## Repository Structure

- `summaries/`: Clean, structured summaries for each course section or video
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks that replicate and expand on course examples
- `projects/`: Sample projects that apply course concepts to real tasks
- `deployment/`: Guides and code for deploying models using Gradio and Hugging Face
- `resources.md`: List of useful links, references, and further reading materials

## Goals

This repository aims to:
- Reinforce theoretical understanding with practical coding examples
- Provide a ready-to-use learning resource for PyTorch beginners
- Offer deployable AI models as real-world examples
